<root>
1 1/4 cups (160 grams) white bread flour, plus more for dusting
1/4 cup (38 grams) stone-ground whole-wheat flour
1/4 cup (32 grams) stone-ground whole rye flour
1/2 teaspoon instant yeast or bread machine yeast
1 teaspoon table salt
1/4 cup (55 grams) dry fermented cider (may substitute Pilsener beer; see headnote)
1/2 cup (120 grams) lukewarm water (80 degrees), plus an optional 1 tablespoon

<step n="1"> Whisk together the flours, yeast and salt in a mixing bowl.</step> <step n="2">Combine the cider and water in a liquid measuring cup.</step>

<step n="3">Add the liquid to the flour mixture; use a spatula or bench scraper or your hand moistened with water to blend them for about a minute. The dough should be shaggy yet cohesive.</step> <step n="4">Cover the bowl with a towel; let the dough rest for 20 minutes.</step>

<step n="5">Moisten your kneading hand.</step> <step n="6">If the dough seems stiff, add the optional tablespoon of water.</step> <step n="7">Stretch one edge of the dough (still in the bowl), then press it into the center of the bowl. Repeat this about a dozen times, moving clockwise to catch all sides of the dough. (This should take 1 or 2 minutes.)</step>

<step n="8">Turn the dough over so the seams are on the bottom. Cover and let rest for 20 minutes.</step> <step n="9">Repeat the clockwise stretching and folding two more times, with 20-minute rests after each.</step> <step n="10">Cover and refrigerate at least 8 hours and up to 24 hours. The dough should have doubled. If it hasn't, leave it on the counter until it does.</step>

<step n="11">Lightly flour a work surface.</step> <step n="12">Use a pastry cloth or clean dish towel to line a round colander. Dust the cloth with flour.</step>

<step n="13">Transfer the dough to the floured work surface. Fold the edges toward the center to create a round shape, turning it over so the seams are on the bottom.</step> <step n="14">Let it rest for 5 minutes, then transfer to the colander, seam side up. Cover with a towel and let the dough rise for 1 1/2 hours.</step>

<step n="15">Thirty minutes before baking, place a cast-iron Dutch oven (lid on) or enameled cast-iron pot with a lid (on) in the oven; preheat to 475 degrees.
</step>
<step n="16">Carefully remove the hot pot from the ov</step>en.

<step n="17">Turn the dough out onto the counter so the seams are on the bottom.</step> <step n="18">Use kitchen scissors to make 8 snips on the top of the dough in an evenly spaced spoke pattern, each about 1/4-inch deep.</step> <step n="19">Lift the dough and carefully drop it into the hot pot. Immediately cover with the hot lid.</step> <step n="20">Bake for 30 minutes, then reduce the heat to 450 degrees</step>. <step n="21">Uncover and bake for 8 to 10 minutes or until the crust is dark brown. Try to minimize the amount of time the oven door is open.</step>

<step n="22">The bread is done when its internal temperature registers 205 degrees on an instant-read thermometer and the loaf sounds hollow when knocked on the underside.</step>

<step n="23">Transfer the loaf to a wire rack to cool for at least 1 hour before cutting.</step>
